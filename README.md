apostrofa
=========
This package contains some utils and algorithms to minimally handle catalan words.

# Current status
- Separate into syllables. *Minimal*
- Categorization into AGUDA, PLANA or ESDRUIXOLA. *Enough*

_Statuses explanation:_
Minimal: Current implementation should be enough to support other algorithms but results won't be right for most cases.
Enough: Should work correctly for most cases but relies on other components that are not fully implemented. Corner cases are not supported yet. Tests coverage is low.
Good: Everything should work as expected and there's good test coverage about it.

# Pending
- Improve syllabification.
- Automatic apostrophize.
- Play around with Machine Learning techniques.
